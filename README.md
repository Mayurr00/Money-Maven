# Money-Maven
Introducing Money Maven, an Al/ML-based application developed by the Straw Hats team in a 24-hour Hackathon. Our team of four individuals came together with the goal of addressing the challenge of managing personal finances effectively while promoting sustainable solutions. 

# Problem Statement
In the year 2050, the population of Earth has reached its peak, and humans have
started to explore other planets for colonization. One such planet, Terra Nova, is
discovered to have abundant natural resources and a favorable environment for
human habitation. However, the colonizers soon realize that they need to manage
their personal finances effectively to sustain their new way of life on the planet.</br>
To address this challenge, a team of hacktronauts need to develop an Al/ML-based
application that helps users manage their personal finances effectively while
promoting sustainable solutions. The application should include features such as </br>
1. Budget tracking
2. Financial planning tools
3. To promote sustainable behavior, the application should make use of an ML
model which gives recommendations based on the spending pattern of the user
4. It should also encourage sustainable behavior such as reducing energy consumption or
promoting the use of renewable resources.
5. The application may also leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
pros users with personalized financial advice and support. 
6. The app may also incentivize the sustainable behavior of users.

# How to use
To download the Money Maven project from both the main and master branches, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.
4. Open the extracted folder and navigate to the "main" and "master" branches.
5. You can download each branch individually by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP" for each branch.</br></br>

Alternatively, you can clone the repository using Git and switch between the main and master branches using the following commands:
$ git clone <repository URL>
$ cd <repository name>
$ git checkout main </br>
To switch to the master branch, use the following command:
$ git checkout master

# Technology used
The technology used in the development of Money Maven includes Streamlit, React, HTML, and CSS.
1. Streamlit is a Python library used for building interactive web applications for data science and machine learning. It was used to create the backend of our application, which includes the ML model that provides recommendations based on user spending patterns.
2. React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. We used React to create the front-end of our application, including the user interface and user experience design.
3. HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It was used to structure the content of our web application.
4. CSS is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of web pages. We used CSS to style the user interface and make it visually appealing.

# Note
"Money Maven - Al/ML-based Personal Finance Management Application" with the project's codebase split into "main" and "master" branches.
